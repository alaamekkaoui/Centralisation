<hr><h2>2. <a name="SecurityAudit">Security Audit</a></h2>
<h3>2.1. <a name="sec_Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
DXC Technology performed a security audit of the Cisco Router R1 on Monday 22nd July 2024. This section details the findings of the security audit together with the impact and recommendations.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.2. <a name="sec_Dictionary-basedPassword/Key">Dictionary-based Password / Key</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Attackers will often have dictionaries of words that contain names, places, default passwords and other common passwords. If a password or key is likely to be contained within an attacker's dictionary, they could gain access to the system.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The passwords and keys of the device R1 were tested against a small dictionary and one password / key was identified. The read-only Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) community string was public.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who was able to identify a password or key would be able to gain a level of access to the device, based on what service the password / key was used for.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Tools are available on the Internet that can perform dictionary-based password guessing against a number of network services.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology strongly recommends that the password identified be immediately changed to something that is more difficult to guess. DXC Technology recommends that passwords be made up of at least eight characters in length and contain numbers.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.3. <a name="sec_WeakPasswords/Keys">Weak Passwords / Keys</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Strong passwords tend to contain a number of different types of character, such as uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and punctuation characters. Weaker passwords tend not to contain a mixture of character types. Additionally, weaker passwords tend to be short in length.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology identified two passwords / keys that did not meet the minimum password complexity requirements. These are listed in Table 2.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<table class="table">
 <caption>Table 2: Weak passwords / keys</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Type</th>
   <th>Service</th>
   <th>Username</th>
   <th>Password</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
 <tbody>
<tr><td>Community</td><td>SNMP</td><td>read-only</td><td>public</td></tr>
<tr><td>Password</td><td>Line</td><td>VTY lines 0 - 4</td><td>router1</td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;<br>

<b>Impact:</b> If an attacker were able to gain a password or key, either through dictionary-based guessing techniques or by a brute-force method, the attacker could gain a level of access to R1.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> A number of dictionary-based password guessing and password brute-force tools are available on the Internet.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology strongly recommends that the weak passwords be immediately changed to ones that are stronger. DXC Technology recommends that passwords be made up of at least eight characters in length and contain numbers.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.4. <a name="sec_ConfigurationAuto-Loading">Configuration Auto-Loading</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Cisco devices are capable of loading their configuration from other network devices, rather than using a local configuration file.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Although the configuration auto-loading feature is typically disabled by default on Cisco devices, DXC Technology determined that the R1 had configuration auto-loading enabled.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> The Cisco device configuration files are transmitted unencrypted over the network. An attacker who is able to monitor the network would be able to capture a copy of the device configuration. The attacker would also be able to capture any clear-text passwords or password hashes contained within the configuration file.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Tools are widely available on the Internet that would allow an attacker to capture network traffic and reconstruct network streams.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that, if not required, configuration auto-loading be disabled. The following Cisco Internet Operating System (IOS) commands can be used to disable configuration auto-loading:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no boot network</div>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no service config</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.5. <a name="sec_InboundTCPConnectionKeepAlives">Inbound TCP Connection Keep Alives</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Connections to a Cisco Router device could become orphaned if a connection becomes disrupted. An attacker could attempt a Denial of Service (DoS) attack against a Cisco Router by exhausting the number of possible connections. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) keep alive messages can be configured to confirm that a remote connection is valid and then terminate any orphaned connections.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology determined that TCP keep alive messages are not sent for connections from remote hosts.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker could attempt a DoS by exhausting the number of possible connections.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Tools are available on the Internet that can open large numbers of TCP connections without correctly terminating them.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that TCP keep alive messages be sent to detect and drop orphaned connections from remote systems. TCP keep alive messages can be enabled for connections from remote systems using the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">service tcp-keepalives-in</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.6. <a name="sec_ConnectionTimeout">Connection Timeout</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Connection timeouts can be configured for a number of the device services. If a timeout were configured on an administrative service, an administrator that did not correctly terminate the connection would have it automatically closed after the timeout expires. However, if a timeout is not configured, or is configured to be a long timeout, an unauthorised user may be able to gain access using the administrator's previously logged-in connection.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology identified three connection settings that were not configured to timeout within ten minutes, these are listed in Table 3.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<table class="table">
 <caption>Table 3: Connections with inadequate timeout periods</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Connection</th>
   <th>Timeout</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
 <tbody>
<tr><td>Console line 0</td><td>No Timeout</td></tr>
<tr><td>Auxiliary line 0</td><td>No Timeout</td></tr>
<tr><td>VTY lines 0 to 4</td><td>No Timeout</td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;<br>

<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who was able to gain access to a connection that had not expired, would be able to continue using that connection. A connection could be a console port on the device that was not correctly terminated or a remote administrative connection.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> The attacker would have to gain physical access to the device to use the console port, or gain remote access to an administration machine that is attached to the port. To gain access to remote connections, an attacker would have to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and R1. The attacker would then have to take over the connection, which could be very difficult with some services. Tools are available on the Internet that would facilitate the monitoring of network connections.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that a timeout period of ten minutes be configured for connections to the device R1.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.7. <a name="sec_AuxiliaryPort">Auxiliary Port</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> The auxiliary port's primary purpose is to provide a remote administration capability. It can allow a remote administrator to use a modem to dial into the Cisco device.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology determined that the auxiliary port on the Cisco device R1 allowed exec connections and did not appear to have the callback feature configured.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker may discover the modem number for the device during a war-dial. If an attacker were able to connect to the device remotely, then they may be able to brute-force the login to gain access to the device.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> The attacker would have to first identify the telephone number of the device, probably through a war-dial. A modem attached to a telephone line would have to be attached directly to the Cisco device's auxiliary port. Then the attacker would be able to attach to the device in order to perform a brute-force of the login.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that, if not required, the auxiliary port exec be disabled. Exec can be disabled on the aux port with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no exec</div>&nbsp;<br>
If the auxiliary port is required for remote administration, the callback feature can be configured to dial a specific preconfigured telephone number.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.8. <a name="sec_IPSourceRouting">IP Source Routing</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> IP source routing is a feature whereby a network packet can specify how it should be routed through the network. Cisco routers normally accept and process source routes specified by a packet, unless the feature has been disabled.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology determined that IP source routing was not disabled.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> IP source routing can allow an attacker to specify a route for a network packet to follow, possibly to bypass a Firewall device or an Intruder Detection System (IDS). An attacker could also use source routing to capture network traffic by routing it through a system controlled by the attacker.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> An attacker would have to control either a routing device or an end point device in order to modify a packets route through the network. However, tools are available on the Internet that would allow an attacker to specify source routes. Tools are also available to modify network routing using vulnerabilities in some routing protocols.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that, if not required, IP source routing be disabled. IP source routing can be disabled by issuing the following IOS command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip source routing</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.9. <a name="sec_SimpleNetworkManagementProtocol">Simple Network Management Protocol</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> SNMP is used to assist network administrators in monitoring and managing a wide variety of network devices. There are three main versions of SNMP in use. Versions 1 and 2 of SNMP are both secured with a community string and authenticate and transmit network packets without any form of encryption. SNMP version 3 provides several levels of authentication and encryption. The most basic level provides a similar protection to that of the earlier protocol versions. However, SNMP version 3 can be configured to provide encrypted authentication (auth) and secured further with support for encrypted data communications (priv).<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology determined that SNMP protocol version 1 was configured on R1.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Due to the unencrypted nature of SNMP protocol versions 1 and 2c, an attacker who was able to monitor network traffic could capture device configuration settings, including authentication details.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Network packet monitoring and capture tools are widely available on the Internet and SNMP tools are included as standard with some operating systems.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that, if possible, SNMP version 1 be disabled. Furthermore, DXC Technology recommends that, if SNMP is required, protocol version 3 be configured with Auth and Priv authentication. SNMP protocol version 1 can be disabled with the following command for each community string:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no snmp-server community {<i>Community String</i>} {[RO] | [RW]}</div>&nbsp;<br>
SNMP version 3 Auth and Priv access can be configured with the following commands:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">snmp-server group {<i>Group Name</i>} v3 priv</div>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">snmp-server user {<i>Username</i>} {<i>Group Name</i>} v3 auth md5 {<i>Auth Keyword</i>} priv {[3des] | [aes 128] | [aes 192]} {<i>Priv Keyword</i>}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.10. <a name="sec_Telnet">Telnet</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Telnet is widely used to provide remote command-based access to a variety of devices and is commonly used on network devices for remote administration. However, Telnet is a clear-text protocol and is vulnerable to various packet capture techniques.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology determined that Telnet was enabled on R1.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who was able to monitor network traffic could capture sensitive information or authentication credentials.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Network packet and password sniffing tools are widely available on the Internet and some of the tools are specifically designed to capture clear-text protocol authentication credentials. However, in a switched environment an attacker may not be able to capture network traffic destined for other devices without employing an attack such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that, if possible, Telnet be disabled. If remote administrative access to the device is required, DXC Technology recommends that Secure Shell (SSH) be configured. The Telnet service can be disabled on individual lines with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">transport input none</div>&nbsp;<br>
The following Cisco IOS command can be used to disable Telnet on individual lines, but enable SSH:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">transport input ssh</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.11. <a name="sec_ICMPRedirects">ICMP Redirects</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirect messages allow systems to change the route that network traffic takes. On networks with functional network routing, disabling ICMP redirects will have little to no effect. ICMP redirects are usually enabled by default on Cisco devices.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology determined that the device R1 had support for ICMP redirects enabled on the network interfaces listed in Table 4.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<table class="table">
 <caption>Table 4: Interfaces with ICMP redirects enabled</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Interface</th>
   <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
 <tbody>
<tr><td>GigabitEthernet1</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>GigabitEthernet0</td><td> </td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;<br>

<b>Impact:</b> An attacker could use ICMP redirect messages to route network traffic through their own router, possibly allowing them to monitor network traffic.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Tools are widely available that can send ICMP redirect messages.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that, if not required, ICMP redirects be disabled on all network interfaces. ICMP redirects can be disabled on each individual network interface using the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip redirects</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.12. <a name="sec_Logging">Logging</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Logging is an essential component of a secure network configuration. Logging not only assists network administrators to identify issues when troubleshooting, but enables network administrators to react to intrusion attempts or Denial-of-Service attacks. It is therefore critical that logs be monitored, allowing administrators to take immediate action when an attack has been identified. Furthermore, system logs are a key component of a forensic investigation into past intrusions or service disruptions.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology determined that logging had not been configured on R1.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker could attempt to map and bypass any configured Access Control List (ACL) or to gain access to the Cisco Router without network administrators being alerted to the attempts. Furthermore, after an unauthorised intrusion into the network had been detected, it would be more difficult for an investigation to identify the source of the attack or the entry point without access to logs.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> N/A<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that Syslog and Buffered logging be configured on R1. Logging can be enabled with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging on</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
To configure Syslog logging, four things need to be set; a source interface for the Syslog messages to be sent from, one or more Syslog hosts to send messages to, the Syslog logging message severity level and the Syslog facility. The following commands can be used to configure Syslog logging:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging source-interface {<i>Interface</i>}</div>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging host {<i>Syslog IP address or hostname</i>}</div>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging trap {<i>Logging message severity level</i>}</div>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging facility {<i>Syslog facility</i>}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
Buffered logging can be configured with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging buffered {<i>Buffer Size</i>} {<i>Logging message severity level</i>}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.13. <a name="sec_ProxyARP">Proxy ARP</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> ARP is a protocol that network hosts use to translate network addresses into media addresses. Under normal circumstances, ARP packets are confined to the sender's network segment. However, a Cisco router with Proxy ARP enabled on network interfaces can act as a proxy for ARP, responding to queries and acting as an intermediary.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology identified two interfaces that had Proxy ARP enabled. These are listed in Table 5.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<table class="table">
 <caption>Table 5: Interfaces with Proxy ARP enabled</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Interface</th>
   <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
 <tbody>
<tr><td>GigabitEthernet1</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>GigabitEthernet0</td><td> </td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;<br>

<b>Impact:</b> A router that acts as a proxy for ARP requests will extend layer two access across multiple network segments, breaking perimeter security.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> A Cisco device with Proxy ARP enabled will proxy ARP requests for all hosts on those interfaces.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that, if not required, Proxy ARP be disabled on all interfaces. Proxy ARP can be disabled on each interface with the following Cisco IOS command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip proxy-arp</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.14. <a name="sec_CiscoDiscoveryProtocol">Cisco Discovery Protocol</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is a proprietary protocol that is primarily used by Cisco, but has been used by others. CDP allows some network management applications and CDP aware devices to identify each other on a Local Area Network (LAN) segment. Cisco devices, including switches, bridges and routers are configured to broadcast CDP packets by default. The devices can be configured to disable the CDP service or disable CDP on individual network interfaces.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology determined that the CDP service had not been disabled, and additionally, had not been disabled on all the active network interfaces.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> CDP packets contain information about the sender, such as hardware model information, operating system version and IP address details. This information would allow an attacker to gain information about the configuration of the network infrastructure.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> CDP packets are broadcast to an entire network segment. An attacker could use one of the many publicly available tools to capture network traffic and view the leaked information.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that, if not required, the CDP service be disabled on the Cisco device R1. If CDP is required, DXC Technology recommends that CDP be disabled on all interfaces except those that are explicitly required.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The CDP service can be disabled by issuing the following Cisco IOS command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no cdp run</div>&nbsp;<br>
CDP can be disabled on individual interfaces using the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no cdp enable</div>&nbsp;<br>
In some configurations with IP phones, deployed using either Auto Discovery or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), the CDP service may need to be enabled. In this situation CDP should be disabled on all network interfaces for which it is not required.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.15. <a name="sec_ClasslessRouting">Classless Routing</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Classless routing is enabled by default on Cisco routers. If a router has classless routing enabled and it receives a network packet for which there is no configured route, the router will forward the packet to the best destination. With classless routing disabled, the router would discard any network traffic for which no route is defined.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology determined that classless routing was enabled on R1.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Network traffic that should not be routed by the router may be routed when classless routing is enabled.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> N/A<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that, if possible, classless routing be disabled. Classless routing can be disabled with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip classless</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.16. <a name="sec_BOOTP">BOOTP</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> BOOTstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a datagram protocol that allows compatible hosts to load their operating system over the network from a BOOTP server. Cisco routers are capable of acting as BOOTP servers for other Cisco devices and the service is enabled by default. However, BOOTP is rarely used and may represent a security risk.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology determined that BOOTP was not disabled. However, it is worth noting that not all Cisco devices support BOOTP.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker could use the BOOTP service to download a copy of the router's IOS software.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Tools are available on the Internet to access BOOTP servers.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that, if not required, the BOOTP service be disabled. The following command can be used to disable BOOTP:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip bootp server</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.17. <a name="sec_IPUnreachables">IP Unreachables</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> ICMP IP unreachable messages can be generated by a Cisco device when a host attempts to connect to a non-existent host, network, or use an unsupported protocol. ICMP IP unreachable messages will let the connecting host know that the host, network or protocol is not supported or cannot be contacted. Therefore, the host does not have to wait for a connection time-out. ICMP IP unreachable messages are normally enabled by default on Cisco devices and must be explicitly disabled.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology determined that the Cisco device R1 had ICMP IP unreachable messages enabled on the interfaces listed in Table 6.<br>
&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>

<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who was performing network scans to determine what services were available would be able to scan a device more quickly.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Tools are available on the Internet that can perform a wide variety of scan types.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that, if not required, IP unreachables be disabled on all network interfaces. However, whilst disabling IP unreachables will not stop scans, it does make it more difficult for an attacker. The IP unreachables option is disabled or enabled individually for each network interface. It can be disabled with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip unreachables</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.18. <a name="sec_ServicePasswordEncryption">Service Password Encryption</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Cisco service passwords are stored by default in their clear-text form rather than being encrypted. However, it is possible to have these passwords stored using the reversible Cisco type-7 encryption.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology determined that the Cisco device R1 was not running the password encryption service that helps provide a basic level of encryption to passwords that otherwise would be stored in clear-text.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> If a malicious user were to see a Cisco configuration that contained clear-text passwords, they could use the passwords to access the device. However, an attacker who had access to a Cisco configuration file would easily be able to reverse the passwords.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Even though it is trivial to reverse Cisco type-7 passwords, they do provide a greater level of security than clear-text passwords. Tools are widely available on the Internet that reverse Cisco type-7 passwords.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that the Cisco password encryption service be enabled. The Cisco password encryption service can be started with the following Cisco IOS command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">service password-encryption</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.19. <a name="sec_LoginBanner">Login Banner</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> A banner message can be shown to users who connect to one of the remote management services, such as Telnet. Typically banner messages will include information on the law with regard to unauthorised access to the device, warning users who do not have the authority to access the device about the consequences.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology determined that no login banner was configured.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Attackers who have gained access to a device could avoid legal action if no banner is configured to warn against unauthorised access.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> N/A<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that a banner be configured that warns against unauthorised access. Banners are configured on Cisco devices using a delimiter character. A delimiter character is specified in the banner command and is used again to mark the end of the banner. The Cisco command to add a login banner, that is presented to users prior to authentication, is:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">banner login {<i>delimiter</i>} <i>The banner text</i> {<i>delimiter</i>}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.20. <a name="sec_DomainLookups">Domain Lookups</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Cisco IOS-based devices support name lookups using the Domain Name System (DNS). However, if a DNS server has not been configured, then the DNS request is broadcast.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology determined that name lookups had not been disabled and no DNS servers had been configured.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who was able to capture network traffic could monitor DNS queries from the Cisco Router. Furthermore, Cisco devices can connect to Telnet servers by supplying only the hostname or IP address of the server. A mistyped Cisco command could be interpreted as an attempt to connect to a Telnet server and broadcast on the network.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> It would be trivial for an attacker to capture network traffic broadcast from a Cisco Router. Furthermore, network traffic capture tools are widely available on the Internet.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that domain lookups be disabled. Domain lookups can be disabled with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip domain-lookup</div>&nbsp;<br>
If domain lookups are required, DXC Technology recommends that DNS be configured. DNS can be configured with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">ip name-server {<i>IP address</i>}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.21. <a name="sec_PacketAssembler/Disassembler">Packet Assembler / Disassembler</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> The Packet Assembler / Disassembler (PAD) service enables X.25 connections between network systems. The PAD service is enabled by default on most Cisco IOS devices but it is only required if support for X.25 links is necessary.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology determined that the PAD service had not been disabled.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Running unused services increases the chances of an attacker finding a security hole or fingerprinting a device.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> N/A<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that, if not required, the PAD service be disabled. Use the following command to disable the PAD service:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no service pad</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.22. <a name="sec_MaintenanceOperationsProtocol">Maintenance Operations Protocol</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Maintenance Operations Protocol (MOP) is used with the DECnet protocol suite. MOP is enabled by default on ethernet interfaces in some versions of IOS.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
DXC Technology determined that MOP had not been disabled on all ethernet interfaces.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Running unused services increases the chances of an attacker finding a security hole or fingerprinting a device.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> N/A<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> DXC Technology recommends that, if not required, MOP be disabled on all ethernet interfaces. MOP can be disabled on each interface with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no mop enabled</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>

<h3>3.7. <a name="con_SimpleNetworkManagementProtocol">Simple Network Management Protocol</a></h3>
SNMP is used to assist network administrators in monitoring and managing a wide variety of network devices. There are three main versions of SNMP in use. Versions 1 and 2 of SNMP are both secured with a community string and authenticate and transmit network packets without any form of encryption. SNMP version 3 provides several levels of authentication and encryption. The most basic level provides a similar protection to that of the earlier protocol versions. However, SNMP version 3 can be configured to provide encrypted authentication (auth) and secured further with support for encrypted data communications (priv).<br>

The Cisco line configuration settings are used to configure administrative access to the device. The console line type is used for accessing the Cisco device directly through a cable attached to the device's console port. The auxiliary lines are used for remote access to the device, typically through attached modems. The Virtual Teletype (VTY) lines are used for access to the device through a remote access service such as SSH or Telnet.<br>
